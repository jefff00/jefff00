    This is probably one of my more useful app but sadly it can't be published by Google PlayStore!!!

    I started this project to solve my own problem of not being able to keep track of SafeEntry visits. Proper usage of SafeEntry actually requires people to screenshot and keep records but not many people do so. The challenge in this project was detecting when the user taps on the check-in, check-out button on the SafeEntry webpage and also understanding the user flows in order to improve the UX.
    This project was implemented in Android using recommended practices such as Android Room, Material Design.

    I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

    This was a fun weekend project to scrape 4D results off Singapore Pools website since no API is released for such data. Scraping is performed with Python scripts at random intervals to not overwhelm the server and the scraped data is stored in sqlite db for simple anaysis and the results displayed in a Flask powered website. The challenge in this project is that Same-Origin Policy is setup on the server and the data cannot be obtained by simply making GET requests. A workaround using Selenium WebDriver in headless mode was implemented.
